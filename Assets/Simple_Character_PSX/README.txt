  Simple PSX Character
  Created by JashiPSX
===================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a simple low-poly 3D character model inspired by PS1-style horror and retro games.  
The model is optimized for use in game engines such as Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, or in 3D software like Blender.

The asset is UV-unwrapped, smoothed-shaded, fully rigged, and textured for a classic PSX look.  
The model is divided into separate parts (head, body, arms).  
A single material is applied to the whole character, except for the head, which includes an additional glass material for the character’s glasses lens.
